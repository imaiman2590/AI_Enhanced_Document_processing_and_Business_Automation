# Document Processing and Business Automation

This project aims to automate various business processes involving document management and analysis. The system leverages advanced machine learning models to perform a variety of tasks, such as fraud detection, document classification, invoice approval, and payment prediction. The application processes various document formats (e.g., images, PDFs) and uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automate critical decision-making tasks.

## Features

### 1. **Fraud Detection**

* Utilizes machine learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks and Random Forest to predict fraudulent transactions or invoices.
* The system can be trained on historical data and then predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not.

### 2. **Document Classification**

* Classifies documents (e.g., invoices, receipts, contracts) into predefined categories using deep learning models and classical machine learning algorithms.
* Supports the automatic classification of incoming documents for routing, archiving, and further processing.

### 3. **Invoice Approval**

* Automatically approves or rejects invoices based on predefined rules and machine learning models.
* Features support for decision trees, random forests, and deep learning models for making invoice approval decisions.

### 4. **Payment Predictor**

* Predicts when a payment is likely to be made, based on historical data and invoice characteristics.
* Uses time-series analysis and regression models to predict payment behavior and timelines.

### 5. **Text Extraction and Analysis**

* Extracts text from images and PDF documents using OCR (Tesseract) and pdfplumber.
* The extracted text is processed using Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to identify and extract important fields like amounts, vendors, dates, and other relevant data.

### 6. **Database Integration**

* Saves extracted data in an SQLite database, which can be used for further analysis and reporting.
* Automatically stores and retrieves data related to invoices, payments, and document classifications.

### 7. **Streamlit Interface**

* A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy document upload, data extraction, and viewing saved data.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Libraries:

  * `streamlit`
  * `torch`
  * `transformers`
  * `pytesseract`
  * `pdfplumber`
  * `Pillow`
  * `sqlite3`
  * `asyncio`
  * `keras`
  * `tensorflow`
  * `numpy`
  * `scikit-learn`

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, Tesseract must be installed on your machine. You can download it from the official repository: [Tesseract GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/document-processing-business-automation.git
   cd document-processing-business-automation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Install the necessary dependencies by running the following:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the Streamlit app**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will start the app on your local machine, and you can access it in the browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Features Breakdown

### 1. **Fraud Detection**

The fraud detection system uses advanced machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models (e.g., LSTM) and classical models like Random Forest, to detect fraudulent activities in invoice data. The fraud detection model can be trained using historical data, which helps the system classify future invoices as legitimate or fraudulent.

### 2. **Document Classification**

The system can classify documents like invoices, receipts, contracts, etc., based on predefined labels. This can be accomplished using both traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning models. Document classification helps in automating workflows and organizing documents efficiently.

### 3. **Invoice Approval**

The invoice approval system automates the decision-making process for invoice validation. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to determine whether an invoice should be approved or rejected. The system can be integrated into a larger business process where invoices are automatically processed without human intervention.

### 4. **Payment Prediction**

This feature uses machine learning regression models to predict when a payment will be made. By analyzing historical payment data and invoice characteristics, the system predicts the likely payment date and can help businesses manage cash flow more effectively.

### 5. **Text Extraction from Documents**

* **OCR for Images**: Tesseract OCR is used to extract text from images (e.g., scanned invoices or receipts).
* **PDF Text Extraction**: `pdfplumber` is used to extract text from PDF documents.
* **NER for Data Extraction**: Extracts key information such as invoice amounts, vendors, and dates using a pre-trained BERT-based NER model.

### 6. **Data Storage & Database**

The extracted data from documents is stored in an SQLite database for further processing or reporting. This feature ensures that the extracted information is organized and accessible.

### 7. **Streamlit Interface**

The app provides a simple and interactive user interface for document upload, data extraction, and management of saved data. Users can upload invoices, view extracted data, and interact with the results using an intuitive web interface.

## Example Usage

Once the app is running:

1. **Upload Document**:

   * Choose a document to upload (image or PDF).
   * Click "Extract and Save Invoice Data" to process the document and save the extracted data to the database.
2. **View Saved Data**:

   * Select "View Saved Data" in the sidebar to view previously processed invoices saved in the database.

## Database Structure

The data extracted from invoices is stored in an SQLite database named `invoice_data.db`. The table contains the following columns:

* **amount**: Real - Amount extracted from the invoice.
* **vendor**: Text - Vendor name.
* **vendor\_type**: Integer - Vendor type (can be customized).
* **date\_feature**: Integer - Processed date features (can be customized).
* **decision**: Text - Invoice approval decision (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected).
* **timestamp**: Datetime - Timestamp when the data was extracted.
